  "description": "   The <SELECT> element constrains the form field to an enumerated list
   of values. The values are given in <OPTION> elements.  Attributes
   are:

    MULTIPLE
            indicates that more than one option may be included in
            the value.

    NAME
            specifies the name of the form field.

    SIZE
            specifies the number of visible items. Select fields of
            size one are typically pop-down menus, whereas select
            fields with size greater than one are typically lists.

    For example:

    <SELECT NAME=\"flavor\">
    <OPTION>Vanilla
    <OPTION>Strawberry
    <OPTION value=\"RumRasin\">Rum and Raisin
    <OPTION selected>Peach and Orange
    </SELECT>

   The initial state has the first option selected, unless a SELECTED
   attribute is present on any of the <OPTION> elements."
