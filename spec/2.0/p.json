  "description": "   The <P> element indicates a paragraph. The exact indentation, leading
   space, etc. of a paragraph is not specified and may be a function of
   other tags, style sheets, etc.

   Typically, paragraphs are surrounded by a vertical space of one line
   or half a line. The first line in a paragraph is indented in some
   cases.

   Example of use:

    <H1>This Heading Precedes the Paragraph</H1>
    <P>This is the text of the first paragraph.
    <P>This is the text of the second paragraph. Although you do not
    need to start paragraphs on new lines, maintaining this
    convention facilitates document maintenance.</P>
    <P>This is the text of a third paragraph.</P>"
}
