  "abstract": "The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used
   to create hypertext documents that are platform independent. HTML
   documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are
   appropriate for representing information from a wide range of
   domains. HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail,
   documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query
   results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; and
   hypertext views of existing bodies of information.

   HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web (WWW) global information
   initiative since 1990. This specification roughly corresponds to the
   capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994. HTML is an
   application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information Processing Text and
   Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).

   The \"text/html\" Internet Media Type (RFC 1590) and MIME Content Type
   (RFC 1521) is defined by this specification.",
