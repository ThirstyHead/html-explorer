  "description": "   The six heading elements, <H1> through <H6>, denote section headings.
   Although the order and occurrence of headings is not constrained by
   the HTML DTD, documents should not skip levels (for example, from H1
   to H3), as converting such documents to other representations is
   often problematic.

   Example of use:

    <H1>This is a heading</H1>
    Here is some text
    <H2>Second level heading</H2>
    Here is some more text.

    Typical renderings are:

    H1
            Bold, very-large font, centered. One or two blank lines
            above and below.

    H2
            Bold, large font, flush-left. One or two blank lines
            above and below.

    H3
            Italic, large font, slightly indented from the left
            margin. One or two blank lines above and below.

    H4
            Bold, normal font, indented more than H3. One blank line
            above and below.

    H5
            Italic, normal font, indented as H4. One blank line
            above.

    H6
            Bold, indented same as normal text, more than H5. One
            blank line above.
