  "description": "   The <BLOCKQUOTE> element contains text quoted from another source.

   A typical rendering might be a slight extra left and right indent,
   and/or italic font. The <BLOCKQUOTE> typically provides space above
   and below the quote.

   Single-font rendition may reflect the quotation style of Internet
   mail by putting a vertical line of graphic characters, such as the
   greater than symbol (>), in the left margin.

   Example of use:

    I think the play ends
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Soft you now, the fair Ophelia. Nymph, in thy orisons, be all
    my sins remembered.
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    but I am not sure."
}
