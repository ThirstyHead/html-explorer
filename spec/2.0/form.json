  "description": "   The <FORM> element contains a sequence of input elements, along
   with document structuring elements. The attributes are:

    ACTION
            specifies the action URI for the form. The action URI of
            a form defaults to the base URI of the document (see 7,
            \"Hyperlinks\").

    METHOD
            selects a method of accessing the action URI. The set of
            applicable methods is a function of the scheme of the
            action URI of the form. See 8.2.2, \"Query Forms:
            METHOD=GET\" and 8.2.3, \"Forms with Side-Effects:
            METHOD=POST\".

    ENCTYPE
            specifies the media type used to encode the name/value
            pairs for transport, in case the protocol does not
            itself impose a format. See 8.2.1, \"The form-urlencoded
            Media Type\"."
