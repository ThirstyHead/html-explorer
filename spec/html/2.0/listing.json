  "description": "   The <XMP> and <LISTING> elements are similar to the <PRE> element,
   but they have a different syntax. Their content is declared as CDATA,
   which means that no markup except the end-tag open delimiter-in-
   context is recognized (see 9.6 \"Delimiter Recognition\" of [SGML]).

      NOTE - In a previous draft of the HTML specification, the syntax
      of <XMP> and <LISTING> elements allowed closing tags to be treated
      as data characters, as long as the tag name was not <XMP> or
      <LISTING>, respectively.

   Since CDATA declared content has a number of unfortunate interactions
   with processing techniques and tends to be used and implemented
   inconsistently, HTML documents should not contain <XMP> nor <LISTING>
   elements -- the <PRE> tag is more expressive and more consistently
   supported.

   The <LISTING> element should be rendered so that at least 132
   characters fit on a line. The <XMP> element should be rendered so
   that at least 80 characters fit on a line but is otherwise identical
   to the <LISTING> element.

      NOTE - In a previous draft, HTML included a <PLAINTEXT> element
      that is similar to the <LISTING> element, except that there is no
      closing tag: all characters after the <PLAINTEXT> start-tag are
      data."
