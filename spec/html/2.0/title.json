  "description": "Every HTML document must contain a <TITLE> element.

   The title should identify the contents of the document in a global
   context. A short title, such as \"Introduction\" may be meaningless out
   of context. A title such as \"Introduction to HTML Elements\" is more
   appropriate.

      NOTE - The length of a title is not limited; however, long titles
      may be truncated in some applications. To minimize this
      possibility, titles should be fewer than 64 characters.

   A user agent may display the title of a document in a history list or
   as a label for the window displaying the document. This differs from
   headings (5.4, \"Headings: H1 ... H6\"), which are typically displayed
   within the body text flow."
