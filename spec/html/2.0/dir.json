  "description": "   The <DIR> element is similar to the <UL> element. It represents a
   list of short items, typically up to 20 characters each. Items in a
   directory list may be arranged in columns, typically 24 characters
   wide.

   The content of a <DIR> element is a sequence of <LI> elements.
   Nested block elements are not allowed in the content of <DIR>
   elements. For example:

    <DIR>
    <LI>A-H<LI>I-M
    <LI>M-R<LI>S-Z
    </DIR>"
}
