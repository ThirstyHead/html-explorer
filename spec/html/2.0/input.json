  "description": "   The <INPUT> element represents a field for user input. The TYPE
   attribute discriminates between several variations of fields.

   The <INPUT> element has a number of attributes. The set of applicable
   attributes depends on the value of the TYPE attribute.

8.1.2.1. Text Field: INPUT TYPE=TEXT

   The default value of the TYPE attribute is `TEXT', indicating a
   single line text entry field. (Use the <TEXTAREA> element for multi-
   line text fields.)

   Required attributes are:

    NAME
            name for the form field corresponding to this element.

    The optional attributes are:

    MAXLENGTH
            constrains the number of characters that can be entered
            into a text input field. If the value of MAXLENGTH is
            greater the the value of the SIZE attribute, the field
            should scroll appropriately. The default number of
            characters is unlimited.

    SIZE
            specifies the amount of display space allocated to this
            input field according to its type. The default depends
            on the user agent.

    VALUE
            The initial value of the field.

    For example:

<p>Street Address: <input name=street><br>
Postal City code: <input name=city size=16 maxlength=16><br>
Zip Code: <input name=zip size=10 maxlength=10 value=\"99999-9999\"><br>

8.1.2.2. Password Field: INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD

   An <INPUT> element with `TYPE=PASSWORD' is a text field as above,
   except that the value is obscured as it is entered. (see also: 10,
   \"Security Considerations\").

   For example:

<p>Name: <input name=login> Password: <input type=password name=passwd>

8.1.2.3. Check Box: INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX

   An <INPUT> element with `TYPE=CHECKBOX' represents a boolean choice.
   A set of such elements with the same name represents an n-of-many
   choice field. Required attributes are:

    NAME
            symbolic name for the form field corresponding to this
            element or group of elements.

    VALUE
            The portion of the value of the field contributed by
            this element.

    Optional attributes are:

    CHECKED
            indicates that the initial state is on.

    For example:

  <p>What flavors do you like?
  <input type=checkbox name=flavor value=vanilla>Vanilla<br>
  <input type=checkbox name=flavor value=strawberry>Strawberry<br>
  <input type=checkbox name=flavor value=chocolate checked>Chocolate<br>

8.1.2.4. Radio Button: INPUT TYPE=RADIO

   An <INPUT> element with `TYPE=RADIO' represents a boolean choice. A
   set of such elements with the same name represents a 1-of-many choice
   field. The NAME and VALUE attributes are required as for check boxes.
   Optional attributes are:

    CHECKED
            indicates that the initial state is on.
   At all times, exactly one of the radio buttons in a set is checked.
   If none of the <INPUT> elements of a set of radio buttons specifies
   `CHECKED', then the user agent must check the first radio button of
   the set initially.

   For example:

    <p>Which is your favorite?
    <input type=radio name=flavor value=vanilla>Vanilla<br>
    <input type=radio name=flavor value=strawberry>Strawberry<br>
    <input type=radio name=flavor value=chocolate>Chocolate<br>

8.1.2.5. Image Pixel: INPUT TYPE=IMAGE

   An <INPUT> element with `TYPE=IMAGE' specifies an image resource to
   display, and allows input of two form fields: the x and y coordinate
   of a pixel chosen from the image. The names of the fields are the
   name of the field with `.x' and `.y' appended.  `TYPE=IMAGE' implies
   `TYPE=SUBMIT' processing; that is, when a pixel is chosen, the form
   as a whole is submitted.

   The NAME attribute is required as for other input fields. The SRC
   attribute is required and the ALIGN is optional as for the <IMG>
   element (see 5.10, \"Image: IMG\").

   For example:

    <p>Choose a point on the map:
    <input type=image name=point src=\"map.gif\">

8.1.2.6. Hidden Field: INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN

   An <INPUT> element with `TYPE=HIDDEN' represents a hidden field.The
   user does not interact with this field; instead, the VALUE attribute
   specifies the value of the field. The NAME and VALUE attributes are
   required.

   For example:

   <input type=hidden name=context value=\"l2k3j4l2k3j4l2k3j4lk23\">

8.1.2.7. Submit Button: INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT

   An <INPUT> element with `TYPE=SUBMIT' represents an input option,
   typically a button, that instructs the user agent to submit the form.
   Optional attributes are:

    NAME
            indicates that this element contributes a form field
            whose value is given by the VALUE attribute. If the NAME
            attribute is not present, this element does not
            contribute a form field.

    VALUE
            indicates a label for the input (button).

    You may submit this request internally:
    <input type=submit name=recipient value=internal><br>
    or to the external world:
    <input type=submit name=recipient value=world>

8.1.2.8. Reset Button: INPUT TYPE=RESET

   An <INPUT> element with `TYPE=RESET' represents an input option,
   typically a button, that instructs the user agent to reset the form's
   fields to their initial states. The VALUE attribute, if present,
   indicates a label for the input (button).

   When you are finished, you may submit this request:
   <input type=submit><br>
   You may clear the form and start over at any time: <input type=reset>"
}
