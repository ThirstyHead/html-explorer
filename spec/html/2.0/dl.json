  "description": "   A definition list is a list of terms and corresponding definitions.
   Definition lists are typically formatted with the term flush-left and
   the definition, formatted paragraph style, indented after the term.

   The content of a <DL> element is a sequence of <DT> elements and/or
   <DD> elements, usually in pairs. Multiple <DT> may be paired with a
   single <DD> element. Documents should not contain multiple
   consecutive <DD> elements.

   Example of use:

    <DL>
    <DT>Term<DD>This is the definition of the first term.
    <DT>Term<DD>This is the definition of the second term.
    </DL>

   If the DT term does not fit in the DT column (typically one third of
   the display area), it may be extended across the page with the DD
   section moved to the next line, or it may be wrapped onto successive
   lines of the left hand column.

   The optional COMPACT attribute suggests that a compact rendering be
   used, because the list items are small and/or the entire list is
   large.

   Unless the COMPACT attribute is present, an HTML user agent may leave
   white space between successive DT, DD pairs. The COMPACT attribute
   may also reduce the width of the left-hand (DT) column.

    <DL COMPACT>
    <DT>Term<DD>This is the first definition in compact format.
    <DT>Term<DD>This is the second definition in compact format.
    </DL>
