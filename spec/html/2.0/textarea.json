   Attributes are:

    COLS
            the number of visible columns to display for the text
            area, in characters.

    NAME
            Specifies the name of the form field.

    ROWS
            The number of visible rows to display for the text area,
            in characters.

    For example:

    <TEXTAREA NAME=\"address\" ROWS=6 COLS=64>
    HaL Computer Systems
    1315 Dell Avenue
    Campbell, California 95008
    </TEXTAREA>

   The content of the <TEXTAREA> element is the field's initial value.

   Typically, the ROWS and COLS attributes determine the visible
   dimension of the field in characters. The field is typically rendered
   in a fixed-width font. HTML user agents should allow text to extend
   beyond these limits by scrolling as needed.
