   -- UL --
   The <UL> represents a list of items -- typically rendered as a
   bulleted list.

   The content of a <UL> element is a sequence of <LI> elements.  For
   example:

    <UL>
    <LI>First list item
    <LI>Second list item
     <p>second paragraph of second item
    <LI>Third list item
    </UL>



  -- OL --
  The <OL> element represents an ordered list of items, sorted by
  sequence or order of importance. It is typically rendered as a
  numbered list.

  The content of a <OL> element is a sequence of <LI> elements.  For
  example:

   <OL>
   <LI>Click the Web button to open URI window.
   <LI>Enter the URI number in the text field of the Open URI
   window. The Web document you specified is displayed.
     <ol>
      <li>substep 1
      <li>substep 2
     </ol>
   <LI>Click highlighted text to move from one link to another.
   </OL>



  -- DIR --
  The <DIR> element is similar to the <UL> element. It represents a
  list of short items, typically up to 20 characters each. Items in a
  directory list may be arranged in columns, typically 24 characters
  wide.

  The content of a <DIR> element is a sequence of <LI> elements.
  Nested block elements are not allowed in the content of <DIR>
  elements. For example:

   <DIR>
   <LI>A-H<LI>I-M
   <LI>M-R<LI>S-Z
   </DIR>



  -- MENU --
  The <MENU> element is a list of items with typically one line per
  item. The menu list style is typically more compact than the style of
  an unordered list.

  The content of a <MENU> element is a sequence of <LI> elements.
  Nested block elements are not allowed in the content of <MENU>
  elements. For example:

   <MENU>
   <LI>First item in the list.
   <LI>Second item in the list.
   <LI>Third item in the list.
   </MENU>
