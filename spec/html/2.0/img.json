  "description": "   The <IMG> element refers to an image or icon via a hyperlink (see
   7.3, \"Simultaneous Presentation of Image Resources\").

   HTML user agents may process the value of the ALT attribute as an
   alternative to processing the image resource indicated by the SRC
   attribute.

      NOTE - Some HTML user agents can process graphics linked via
      anchors, but not <IMG> graphics. If a graphic is essential, it
      should be referenced from an <A> element rather than an <IMG>
      element. If the graphic is not essential, then the <IMG> element
      is appropriate.

   Attributes of the <IMG> element:

    ALIGN
            alignment of the image with respect to the text
            baseline.

                * `TOP' specifies that the top of the image aligns
                with the tallest item on the line containing the
                image.

                * `MIDDLE' specifies that the center of the image
                aligns with the baseline of the line containing the
                image.

                * `BOTTOM' specifies that the bottom of the image
                aligns with the baseline of the line containing the
                image.

    ALT
            text to use in place of the referenced image resource,
            for example due to processing constraints or user
            preference.

    ISMAP
            indicates an image map (see 7.6, \"Image Maps\").

    SRC
            specifies the URI of the image resource.

                NOTE - In practice, the media types of image
                resources are limited to a few raster graphic
                formats: typically `image/gif', `image/jpeg'. In
                particular, `text/html' resources are not
                intended to be used as image resources.

    Examples of use:

    <IMG SRC=\"triangle.xbm\" ALT=\"Warning:\"> Be sure
    to read these instructions.

    <a href=\"http://machine/htbin/imagemap/sample\">
    <IMG SRC=\"sample.xbm\" ISMAP>
    </a>"
}
